It includes data visualization, outlier detection, feature scaling, PCA, and model evaluation with and without dimensionality reduction.

## Technologies used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Topics covered
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization
- Feature engineering
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)
- Linear regression model

## Note
